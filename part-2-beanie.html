        <h1>Jessica the Pet Rock</h1>
        <p>
            I carried Jessica around in this fuzzy purple beanie. She went everywhere with me.
            Even to see my family in South Africa. We got in a car crash. I was crying when my dad said,
            "Everyone is safe. No one is hurt. Don't cry." And I responded, "Jessica is still in the car!"
            Then my Dad crawled into the evacuated car to rescue my rock.
